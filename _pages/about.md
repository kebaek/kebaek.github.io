Hi! I am a fourth-year PhD student in [**Machine Learning**](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [**Zico Kolter**](https://zicokolter.com/) and  [**Aditi Raghunathan**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/) . I completed my 5th year Master's at UC Berkeley advised by [**Yi Ma**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

I am broadly interested in ML safety and understanding deep learning through scientific methods. My research focuses on understanding the **out-of-distribution robustness and long-tail behaviors** of models. To this end, I have worked on building strategies to assess the model's performance under real-world shifts with limited labeled data. I am also interested in building **safe agentic systems**. I care about mitigating unintended behaviors that may snowball across pretraining, finetuning, and inference.
