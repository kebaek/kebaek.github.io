Hi! I am a fourth-year PhD student in [**Machine Learning**](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [**Zico Kolter**](https://zicokolter.com/) and  [**Aditi Raghunathan**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/) . I completed my 5th year Master's at UC Berkeley advised by [**Yi Ma**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

I interested in robust ML and understanding deep learning through scientific methods. My research focuses on understanding the **out-of-distribution and long-tail behaviors** of models. To this end, I have worked on strategies for model assessment under real-world shifts with limited labeled data. Lately, I've been interested in building **robust agents** by understanding how undesired behaviors trace back to errors that snowball across training, inference, and interaction.
