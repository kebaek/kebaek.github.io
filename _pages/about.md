Hi! I am a fourth-year PhD student in [**Machine Learning**](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [**Zico Kolter**](https://zicokolter.com/) and  [**Aditi Raghunathan**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/) . I completed my 5th year Master's at UC Berkeley advised by [**Yi Ma**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

I am broadly interested in the intersection between ML safety and understanding deep learning through scientific methods. My research focuses on characterizing models' **out-of-distribution robustness and long-tail behaviors**. To this end, I have worked on building designing principled ways to assess/improve the model's performance under real-world shifts with limited labeled data. I am also interested in **mitigating risks in agentic systems**. This requires understanding how different parts of the ML training pipeline affect the model and characterizing unintended behaviors during long-horizon decision making.
