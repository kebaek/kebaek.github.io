Hi! I am a final-year PhD student in [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at CMU advised by [Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/) and  [Aditi Raghunathan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/). I spent two great summers interning at DatologyAI and Google. Prior to graduate school, I completed my 5th year Master's advised by [Yi Ma](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/) and received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

I’m broadly interested in the science of deep learning and designing robust AI systems. Current models are surprisingly brittle under downstream pressures. My research finds systematic ways to _predict, explain, and improve_ how deep models behave in out-of-distribution and long-tailed scenarios. Lately, I've especially been interested in how to properly integrate reasoning and other inference-time strategies for models to reliably handle diverse complex use cases.
