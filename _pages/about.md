Hi! I am a final-year PhD student in [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at CMU advised by [Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/) and  [Aditi Raghunathan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/). I spent two great summers interning at DatologyAI and Google. Prior to graduate school, I completed my 5th year Master's advised by [Yi Ma](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/) and received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

I'm interested in science of deep learning and building more robust AI systems. My research so far finds ways to predict and improve how models behave in **out-of-distribution and long-tailed scenarios**.  Lately, I've been interested in building models that are more flexible to all the diverse ways we use models at inference time. Broadly, some areas include
- Clear insights into how systematic failures (e.g. knowledge conflicts, inefficient test-time scaling) arise. Limitations of current training algorithms.
- How to efficiently adapt models to specific domains.
- Better distillation strategies for small models.
